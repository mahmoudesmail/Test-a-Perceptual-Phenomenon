Analyzing the Stroop Effect
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
(1) What is the independent variable? What is the dependent variable?

The Independent Variable:
Congruent & incongruent words condition
The Dependent Variable:
Time taken to name ink colors

(2) What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? Specify your null and alternative hypotheses, and clearly define any notation used. Justify your choices. What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

Null Hypothesis: at null hypothesis we want to prove that the time of congruent values is the same as incongruent values

Alternative Hypothesis: at alt. hypothesis we want to prove that congruent values and incongruent values are not equal

Statistical Test: I chosen the the dependent t-test, Because we need to determine if there's statistically significant difference between mean population for congruent values and mean population for incongruent values, also we're comparing two dependent variables with each others which are nearly normaly distributed, the tailed test is because we are testing between two means whether they're equal or not
